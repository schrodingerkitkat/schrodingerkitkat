**Lead AI Engineer** · Los Angeles

Building production AI systems — from on-device ML to cloud-scale data infrastructure. Currently focused on RAG architectures, real-time video processing, and the end-to-end tooling that makes AI products actually ship.

### What I Build

**Consumer AI Products**  
iOS apps with on-device ML (CoreML, Vision) — real-time video processing, intelligent editing, and the kind of fluid UX that makes AI feel invisible.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**  
Production RAG pipelines for complex document analysis — vector search, citation traceability, semantic chunking that works on messy real-world data.

**Event-Driven Data Platforms**  
Dagster-orchestrated lakehouses on Databricks. High-velocity ingestion from social APIs. The unsexy infrastructure that makes analytics possible.

**Developer Tools**  
CLI-native monitoring, voice-to-code interfaces, and the small sharp tools that make engineering less painful.
